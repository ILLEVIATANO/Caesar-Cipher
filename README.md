# Caesar-Cipher
A fast implementation of the Caesar Cipher

--HOW DOES IT WORK
The program will encrypt or decrypt a string given in input with the Caesar Cipher. It is supposed that the input is ONLY alphabetical.
It also holds a pratical example (only in the encryption mode) of the use of local variables and accessing varibales through pointers.

Complexity: O(n)
